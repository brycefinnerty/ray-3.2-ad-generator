title: Image editing | Luma Agents
description: Edit existing images with text prompts using the Luma Agents API — background replacement, style transfer, object modification, and more.
---

Modify existing images with natural language instructions. Describe the edit you want and [uni-1](./model.md) applies it while preserving the parts of the image you did not mention. For generating new images from text, see [Image generation](./image-generation.md).

## When to use image editing

Use `type: "image_edit"` when you have an existing image and want to modify it. Use `type: "image"` with `image_ref` when you want to create something new inspired by a reference.

| Scenario                              | Use                                        | Why                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Change a photo's background           | `image_edit` + `source`                    | Keeps the subject, only changes the background                 |
| Convert a photo to manga style        | `image_edit` + `source` + `style: "manga"` | Transforms the existing image                                  |
| Create a new image in a similar style | `image` + `image_ref`                      | Generates something new using the reference for style guidance |
| Combine elements from multiple images | `image` + `image_ref` (multiple)           | Compositing, not editing a single source                       |

## Basic request

An image edit requires three things: `type` set to `"image_edit"`, a `source` image, and a `prompt` describing the edit.

**Python**

```python
from luma_agents import Luma


client = Luma()


generation = client.generations.create(
    type="image_edit",
    prompt="Change the sky to a dramatic sunset with orange and purple clouds",
    source={"url": "https://example.com/landscape.jpg"},
)
```

**TypeScript**

```typescript
import Luma from "luma-agents";


const client = new Luma();


const generation = await client.generations.create({
  type: "image_edit",
  prompt: "Change the sky to a dramatic sunset with orange and purple clouds",
  source: { url: "https://example.com/landscape.jpg" },
});
```

**Go**

```go
generation, err := client.Generations.New(ctx, lumaagents.GenerationNewParams{
    Type:   lumaagents.F(lumaagents.GenerationNewParamsTypeImageEdit),
    Prompt: lumaagents.F("Change the sky to a dramatic sunset with orange and purple clouds"),
    Source: lumaagents.F(lumaagents.GenerationNewParamsSource{
        URL: lumaagents.F("https://example.com/landscape.jpg"),
    }),
})
```

**cURL**

```bash
curl -X POST https://agents.lumalabs.ai/v1/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LUMA_AGENTS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "image_edit",
    "prompt": "Change the sky to a dramatic sunset with orange and purple clouds",
    "source": {
      "url": "https://example.com/landscape.jpg"
    }
  }'
```

**CLI**

```bash
luma-agents-cli generations create \
  --type image_edit \
  --prompt "Change the sky to a dramatic sunset with orange and purple clouds" \
  --source-url "https://example.com/landscape.jpg"
```

## Source image

The `source` field accepts a single image — either as a URL or inline base64 data.

**From a URL:**

```json
{
  "source": {
    "url": "https://example.com/photo.jpg"
  }
}
```

**From base64 data:**

```json
{
  "source": {
    "data": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUA...",
    "media_type": "image/jpeg"
  }
}
```

The `source` field is **required** for `image_edit` and **rejected** for `image` type requests. Provide either `url` or `data` — not both. URLs must be publicly accessible. Base64 images require `media_type`. Maximum image size is 50 MB.

## Style transfer with `style`

Combine `source` with the `style` parameter to apply a style preset to an existing image:

**Python**

```python
generation = client.generations.create(
    type="image_edit",
    prompt="Convert to a bold manga illustration with clean ink outlines and vivid flat colors",
    source={"url": "https://example.com/photograph.jpg"},
    style="manga",
)
```

**cURL**

```bash
curl -X POST https://agents.lumalabs.ai/v1/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LUMA_AGENTS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "image_edit",
    "prompt": "Convert to a bold manga illustration with clean ink outlines and vivid flat colors",
    "source": {"url": "https://example.com/photograph.jpg"},
    "style": "manga"
  }'
```

## Using reference images with edits

Combine `source` (the image to edit) with `image_ref` (style/content references) to guide the edit. Up to 8 reference images are supported.

**Single reference — apply a color grading from a reference:**

```python
generation = client.generations.create(
    type="image_edit",
    prompt="Apply the color grading from the reference to the source image",
    source={"url": "https://example.com/my-photo.jpg"},
    image_ref=[
        {"url": "https://example.com/color-reference.jpg"},
    ],
)
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://agents.lumalabs.ai/v1/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LUMA_AGENTS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "image_edit",
    "prompt": "Apply the color grading from the reference to the source image",
    "source": {"url": "https://example.com/my-photo.jpg"},
    "image_ref": [{"url": "https://example.com/color-reference.jpg"}]
  }'
```

**Multiple references — combine lighting from one and texture from another:**

```python
generation = client.generations.create(
    type="image_edit",
    prompt="Apply the lighting from the first reference and the texture from the second to the source image",
    source={"url": "https://example.com/my-photo.jpg"},
    image_ref=[
        {"url": "https://example.com/lighting-reference.jpg"},
        {"url": "https://example.com/texture-reference.jpg"},
    ],
)
```

```bash
curl -X POST https://agents.lumalabs.ai/v1/generations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LUMA_AGENTS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "image_edit",
    "prompt": "Apply the lighting from the first reference and the texture from the second to the source image",
    "source": {"url": "https://example.com/my-photo.jpg"},
    "image_ref": [
      {"url": "https://example.com/lighting-reference.jpg"},
      {"url": "https://example.com/texture-reference.jpg"}
    ]
  }'
```

When using multiple references, always label each reference's role in the prompt: "Apply the lighting from the first reference and the texture from the second." Without explicit labels, the model guesses which aspects to pull from each image.

## Common edit types

### Object modification

Change colors, materials, or properties of objects in the image:

```python
generation = client.generations.create(
    type="image_edit",
    prompt="Change the car's color to midnight blue with a metallic finish",
    source={"url": "https://example.com/car-photo.jpg"},
)
```

### Background replacement

Replace the background while preserving the subject:

```python
generation = client.generations.create(
    type="image_edit",
    prompt="Replace the background with a tropical beach at sunset, "
           "warm golden light matching the direction of light on the subject",
    source={"url": "https://example.com/portrait.jpg"},
)
```

### Lighting adjustment

Change the lighting or time of day:

```python
generation = client.generations.create(
    type="image_edit",
    prompt="Change the lighting to dramatic golden hour with long shadows from the left",
    source={"url": "https://example.com/scene.jpg"},
)
```

**Be specific about what to change and what to preserve.** "Replace the background with a tropical beach" is better than "make it look tropical." For complex edits (background + color + style), do them as separate sequential operations for more predictable results.

## Validation rules

These constraints are specific to `image_edit` requests. General constraints from [Image generation](./image-generation.md#validation-rules) also apply.

| Rule          | Constraint                                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`        | Must be `"image_edit"`                                   |
| `source`      | **Required.** Must provide `url` or `data` — not both    |
| `source.url`  | Must be publicly accessible. Max 50 MB                   |
| `source.data` | Must be valid base64. Requires `media_type`              |
| `image_ref`   | Optional. Up to 8 additional reference images            |
| `prompt`      | Required. 1–6,000 characters describing the desired edit |

**Common validation errors:**

| Mistake                                 | HTTP code | Error                                                |
| --------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Missing `source`                        | 400       | `"source is required for type 'image_edit'"`         |
| Providing `source` with `type: "image"` | 400       | `"source is only valid for type 'image_edit'"`       |
| `source` with both `url` and `data`     | 400       | `"source: provide either 'url' or 'data', not both"` |
| `source.data` without `media_type`      | 400       | `"source: 'media_type' is required with 'data'"`     |
| `source` image over 50 MB               | 413       | `"source: image exceeds 50 MB limit"`                |
| Unreachable `source.url`                | 422       | `"source: failed to fetch URL"`                      |
| Invalid `source.data`                   | 422       | `"source: invalid base64 data"`                      |

## Response

The response format is identical to image generation — poll `GET /v1/generations/{id}` until the state reaches `completed` or `failed`.

```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890",
  "type": "image_edit",
  "state": "completed",
  "model": "uni-1",
  "created_at": "2026-04-08T12:00:00Z",
  "output": [
    {
      "type": "image",
      "url": "https://storage.example.com/generations/a1b2c3d4/output.png?X-Amz-Expires=3600&..."
    }
  ],
  "failure_reason": null,
  "failure_code": null
}
```

## Full example

The submit-poll-download workflow for image editing is identical to image generation — set `type: "image_edit"` and include a `source` image. See the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) for the complete polling pattern.
